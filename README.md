Jackson Sui's computer engineering profile.

A full-stack developer riveted by what makes an app easy to use. Has experience in science and education, and gets excited by the challenge of ‘how can we make this app better to use?’. Interested in building projects where this challenge is evident, such as mobile apps, games, and education apps, and has experience in all 3 of these areas.  I am currently working as a fellow/teaching assistant at Fullstack Academy, but will begin job searching this coming Febuary(2018). <br />
